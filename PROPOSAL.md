# Proposal 
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create an open frameworks application that uses a significant outside library so that we can be exposed to what making a project is like in the “real world”. 
I figured that why would I make something that I was not interested in, so I decided that for my project proposal I will be creating an application that combines my three biggest interests; NBA, statistics, and programming. 
So, for my project, I hope to make an application that displays the shooting splits and percentages for a specific player chosen from the menu and map those percentages to a heat map/ color-coded half court.
## Goal
My main focus with doing a project of this nature is to get more accustomed to how sports stats are taken and can be digested. As well, I will be learning how to graphically and pictorially represent sports stats. 
In the future, I would like to be a data analyst and eventually a general manager of a sports team, so learning how the stats work and creating a project that uses them is very important to me. 
I took this project as an opportunity to get my feet in the water of the industry that I want to go into. 
## How 
As of right now, I intend to use ofxCurl, json.cpp, and most likely some sort of GUI and UI addon. 
These will be used in conjunction with the probasketball API so that the application can pull the players shooting splits and create the necessary charts. 
As of the proposal, I am assuming that I will only need to use these two potentially three add-ons/libraries
